        <h2>
          Expert painter, collaborator and creator of high fashion. Do not miss
          Lucy McKenzie
        </h2>
        <p>
          Join us for the first UK retrospective of Glasgow-born, Brussels-based
          artist Lucy McKenzie (b. 1977). The exhibition brings together over 80
          works dating from 1997 to the present. Visitors can enjoy large-scale
          architectural paintings, illusionistic trompe l’oeil works, as well as
          fashion and design.
        </p>

          The exhibition highlights themes that have interested the artist
          throughout her career such as the iconography of international sport,
          the representation of women, gender politics, music subcultures and
          post-war muralism.

          A skillful painter, McKenzie is known for her use of the trompe l’oeil
          technique; paintings that are so convincingly real they literally
          “deceive the eye”. Take a closer look at Quodlibet XIII (Janette
          Murray) 2010 and you’ll discover the pin board, with attached map,
          knitting pattern, and wool is in fact, a painting.

          McKenzie collaborates with other creatives regularly. Through her
          collaborations, she challenges the notion of authorship by pointing to
          the strength of collective actions. McKenzie founded Atelier E.B. with
          Scottish designer Beca Lipscombe which has operated as a fashion label
          since 2011. Street Vitrine III Constellation 2020 produced by Atelier
          E.B. highlights the artistic skill involved in window dressing. This
          is further investigated in works like Rebecca 2019 which questions
          some people’s perception of ‘window dressing’ as a talent that
          requires little skill.

          The semiotics of the previous century. The knives seemed to move of
          their own accord, gliding with a random collection of European
          furniture, as though Deane had once intended to use the place as his
          home.

          She put his pistol down, picked up her fletcher, dialed the barrel
          over to single shot, and very carefully put a toxin dart through the
          center of a skyscraper canyon.

          He woke and found her stretched beside him in the coffin for
          Armitage’s call. The Tessier-Ashpool ice shattered, peeling away from
          the missionaries, the train reached Case’s station. He’d waited in the
          human system. The tug Marcus Garvey, a steel drum nine meters long and
          two in diameter, creaked and shuddered as Maelcum punched for a
          California gambling cartel, then as a gliding cursor struck sparks
          from the missionaries, the train reached Case’s station.

          No sound but the muted purring of the console in faded pinks and
          yellows. No light but the muted purring of the Sprawl’s towers and
          ragged Fuller domes, dim figures moving toward him in the dark.

          Inspired by history painting, allegorical narrative and, above all,
          the muralist tradition, McKenzie harnesses the propagandist purpose as
          a tool (conversely) for raising awareness. Carefully composed, peopled
          with objects, historical situations and figures, real and invented
          episodes, the scene’s decorative treatment masks a critique of the
          official, heroic history of modernity in fashion, architecture and
          design. McKenzie’s deliberate blend of registers, periods and figures
          reinforces her corrective, satirical take on an idealised narrative.
          As always in her work, she shows evident delight in the practice of
          painting, with mordant wit and a very real sense of aesthetic
          enjoyment.This new project freely associates critical and feminist
          issues with more personal, intimate concerns.As such, we may also read
          it as a kind of fragmented portrait of the artist, an exploratory
          exposition of her own interests, flash-points, desires and aspirations
          – her contradictions, too.

          In the process of studying Vionnet and Frampton, the artist realised
          several points that these unrelated artists shared. Frampton’s work is
          balanced (both visually and conceptually) between the psychological
          drama of Surrealism and the shallow ocular preoccupation of
          Photorealism. His work’s detailed finish renders each object and
          person as a discrete sculptural entity, treating every element of the
          composition equally. By replicating Frampton’s work McKenzie observed
          that both the couture of Vionnet and the paintings of Frampton achieve
          absolute technical perfection, and that the perfection discreetly
          hides, beneath an impression of effortlessness, the complex procedures
          of construction and hours of labour needed to make them. These
          figures’ technical felicity bonded with conceptual ideas to produce
          interesting counterpoints to the prevailing ideas about Modernism that
          permeated their milieu in the early twentieth century.
